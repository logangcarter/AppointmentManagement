IDE Version: IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2 (Community Edition)

JDK Version: JAVA SE 11.0.10

JFX Version: 11.0.2

Additional Report: I added a report which gets all of the locations that customers
reside in and counts how many customers are from each location.

MYSQL Connector: mysql-connector-java:8.0.25

How To Run:
Once on the Login Page you may enter login credentials and hit login. From there
you will be brought to the Appointment's Calendar. From there you can add, modify 
and delete appointments. At the top you can sort by week and month. The bottom 
left will send you to the reports, the top rightwill send you to the customer 
directory where you can add, modify and delete customers.

Lambdas: My Lambdas statements are in the /controller/AppointmentAddController 
and in /model/User.
